NAME

    Alien::patch - Find or build patch

VERSION

    version 0.02

SYNOPSIS

     use Alien::patch;
     # patch should now be in your PATH if it wasn't already

DESCRIPTION

    Many environments provide the patch command, but a few do not. Using
    this module in your Build.PL (or elsewhere) you can make sure that
    patch will be available. If the system provides it, then great, this
    module is a no-op. If it does not, then it will download and install it
    into a private location so that it can be added to the PATH when this
    module is used.
